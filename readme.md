# Playing Cards - Crazy Eights

Write a program that pits four virtual card players against each other in a simplified version of the card game Crazy Eights (Dutch: “Pesten”). Functionally, the game should work as follows:

  - Shuffle 52 cards, and dea; each player seven cards (no joker cards). The remaining set of cards is called the deal pile.
  - Take a card from the deal pile. This card is the first card that is put in the central discard pile.
  - The players take turns to put a card from their hand on the discard pile. A player may only put a card on the discard pile if the card is of the same suit or the same numerical value.
  - If a player cannot put a card on the discard pile, the player must take a card from the deal pile.
  - If the deal pile is empty, the player skips a turn.
  - If a player has no more cards in his hand, the game is won by that player.
